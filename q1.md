# Question 1
#### Briefly describe the information stored in the file.

# Solution
The file extra-data.json is a multiline JSON file with a JSON object in each line.
These JSON objects have the following properties: 
* Some of the objects are empty `{}`.
* Other objects have atleast one of the following fields:
    * `IMDb_ID` -> Details about `_id` field in `movies` collection.
        * `type` -> Datatype of the value field. `"literal"` for every `IMDb_ID`.
        * `value` -> Value of the `_id` in the form `"tt<_id>"`. Integer part needs to be extracted and parsed to integer.
    * `titleLabel` -> Details about the `title` field in `movies` collection.
        * `type` -> Datatype of the value field. `"literal"` for every `titleLabel`.
        * `value` -> Value of the `title`.
    * `distributorLabel` -> Movie distributor details.
        * `xml:lang` -> 
        * `type` -> Datatype of the value field. `"literal"` for every `distributorLabel`.
        * `value` -> Name of the distributor.
    * `cost` -> Movie budget details.
        * `datatype` -> Datatype of the value to be used when storing it.
        * `type` -> Datatype of the value field. `"literal"` for every `cost`.
        * `value` -> Cost of production of the movie.
    * `box_office_currencyLabel` -> Currency details.
        * `xml:lang` -> 
        * `type` -> Datatype of the value field. `"literal"` for every `box_office_currencyLabel`.
        * `value` -> Full form of currency.
    * `box_office` -> Movie revenue details.
        * `datatype` -> Datatype of the value to be used when storing it.
        * `type` -> Datatype of the value field. `"literal"` for every `box_office`.
        * `value` -> Box office collection of the movie.

Also a few important points:
* It is possible that there are multiple rows for a particular `IMDb_ID.value`.
* It is possible that the `title` in `movies` collection is different that the ones in file for a particular `IMDb_ID.value`.
* It is also possible that there is no `IMDb_ID.value` for few rows. In that case we have to match using `titleLabel.value`.
